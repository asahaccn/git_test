   1. Your Own Repository
      git clone repository url
     //git init to initialize a repository with .git //not needed just to understand
     //gitignore // to add files that we want to be private (for example: in .gitignore file we can add
     .project and  .*cpp) //so it will ignore project directory  and .cpp files
     ls - la to see .directory and rm -rf to remove . directory
     git add filename //to add a single file
     git add . or git add -A //to add all the files
     git commit -m"enter your message" //to commit the files in local repository
     git push //to push the files in remote repository i.e Github
     git status //to see the status of your local repository
     git log //to see commit message, time and date
     git diff //to see the changes made to a file compared to previous
     git reset//to rollback the changes in staging area i.e after we have git add



   2. Open source repository
      fork the repository in your profile
      git clone repository url
      //always remember to work with a new branch
      /*to always make sure that the forked repository we are working with is up-to-date
      git remote - v
      git remote add upstream url of original source repository from were repository was forked
      //we will see the push and fetch link of original repository.
    */
      git branch -a //to check if there is branch other tan master
      git branch test //to create a new branch
      git checkout test//to enter into the branch
      git checkout -b test //short command to create a checkout branch
      /*now add files and commit files in test branch then check master branch and pull the master
       branch again to check that everything is up-to-date
      git checkout master
      git pull*/
      git checkout test//to enter into test branch agin
      git merge master //to merge created branch with master
      git branch --merged //to check branches merged
      git branch -d test //to delete the branch in your local repository
      git push origin --delete test //to delete the branch in remote repository i.e github
      git pull upstream master//to check that the master branch of the original forked repository
                              //and my repository is up-to-date
      git push//finally commit to remote repository

      /*Then go to our branch generate a pull merge request . If your branch is merged with the master
      branch of the open source repository then you can delete your new branch test.
      Next time when you want to push something.You have the original branch pulled to your local
      repository yo can do git pull origin master or git push origin master. */
